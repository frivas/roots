## Commit Reminder
- When you finish applying changes, the last line of the message should say "ðŸ’¾ Don't forget to commit!" 

## Commit Message Best Practice
- Always prefix Commit Messages in the following way. No exceptions!

"Feature(component): add new component"
"Fix(api): fix api error"
"Docs(readme): update readme"
"Refactor(utils): refactor utils"
"Style(tailwind): add new tailwind class"
"Test(unit): add unit test"
"Chore(deps): update dependencies"

## Conventional Commit Types (full list)
- **feat**: a new feature is introduced with the changes
- **fix**: a bug fix has occurred
- **chore**: maintenance, not src or test files (e.g., deps)
- **refactor**: refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **docs**: documentation only
- **style**: formatting, white-space, etc. (no code meaning)
- **test**: adding or correcting tests
- **perf**: performance improvements
- **ci**: continuous integration related
- **build**: build system or external dependencies
- **revert**: reverts a previous commit

## Additional Best Practices
- Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add fix for dark mode toggle state").
- Capitalize the first word, no ending punctuation in the subject.
- Keep the subject line to 50 characters or less.
- Be direct: answer what and why in the message.
- If more detail is needed, add a body (wrap at 72 chars) after a blank line.
- Use optional footers for breaking changes or references (e.g., JIRA, issues).
- Types (prefixes) should be all lowercase if following Conventional Commits.
- Avoid filler words; be concise and clear.
- Example full message:

  Fix(api): fix foo to enable bar

  This fixes the broken behavior of the component by doing xyz.

  BREAKING CHANGE: Before this fix foo wasn't enabled at all, behavior changes from <old> to <new>
  Closes D2IQ-12345
